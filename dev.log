[@sentry/nextjs] It appears you've configured a `sentry.server.config.ts` file. Please ensure to put this file's content into the `register()` function of a Next.js instrumentation file instead. To ensure correct functionality of the SDK, `Sentry.init` must be called inside of an instrumentation file. Learn more about setting up an instrumentation file in Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation. You can safely delete the `sentry.server.config.ts` file afterward.
